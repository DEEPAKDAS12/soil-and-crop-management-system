Crop and Soil Management System
Introduction
The Crop and Soil Management System is designed to assist farmers with essential agricultural decisions, including crop selection based on soil type, soil management, and disease identification. This tool aims to improve agricultural productivity and sustainability by providing easy-to-use features for farmers.

Features
1. User Registration and Login
Farmers can create an account by registering with a username and password.
Registered users can log in to access the system's features.
2. Crop Selection Based on Soil Type
The system suggests the most suitable crops for different soil types, including sandy, clay, and loam soils.
Farmers can input their soil type to receive crop recommendations.
3. Soil Management Tips
The system provides management tips for different soil types to help maintain soil health and fertility.
Tips include suggestions for improving soil conditions and maximizing crop yield.
4. Disease Identification
Farmers can input symptoms observed in their crops, and the system will suggest possible diseases and treatments.
The system currently supports identification based on common symptoms like yellow leaves and spots on leaves.
5. Crop History Tracking
The system maintains a history of crops planted by each farmer, allowing them to track their agricultural activities.
Farmers can view their crop history to make informed decisions for future planting.
Technologies Used
Java: The core programming language used for building the system.
Swing: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) elements like text fields, buttons, and panels.
HashMap: Used for storing soil types and their corresponding crop recommendations and soil management tips.
ArrayList: Used for maintaining a history of crops planted by each farmer.

Future Enhancements
Database Integration: Store user data, soil types, crop recommendations, and crop history in a database for better data management.
Advanced Disease Identification: Implement more advanced algorithms to identify a wider range of plant diseases.
Weather Integration: Provide crop recommendations based on real-time weather data in addition to soil type.
